#How the repository is used

Inside the /trunk folder there are two folders:
Server and Client

Server is the webbapplication, JSP web application (template from oddoneout).
Client is the MIDP-application.


=Server=
_How to create the server project in Netbeans:_

Create new pweb application from existing sources.
Source location: buddytracker/server/
Project name/folder: whatever. I use "BuddyTrackerServerProject"
Netbeans should automatically find web folder and WEB-INF
Source package should be buddytracker/server/src/java/


=Client=
_How to create the client project in Netbeans:_

Create new mobile project with existing MIDP sources.
Then just select buddytracker/client/src/ as source and it should find the JAD-file automatically.

*remember not to put any IDE-specific files inside the svn*
